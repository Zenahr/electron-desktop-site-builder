// Switch to master, pull latest commits and reset local repo with remote repo data

// Make new branch
git checkout -b newbranchname master

commit as always...

// check changes made
git status

// push to branch
git push -u origin branchname
(after the first push you can push everything else using just "git push")

after finishing integration on the branch, do a pull request. and accept it on Github

then do a symbolical commit to master like this:
git checkout master
git pull
git pull origin newbranchname
git push
