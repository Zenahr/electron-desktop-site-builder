# Electron Desktop Site Builder App

## Introduction
Problem this repository solves:
When I create websites for clients, I tend to repeat some inital steps. At the moment I have a template folder on my computer from which I copy the files I need for my new project but this is cumbersome. Wouldn't it be better to have some kind of tool which takes care of that?

That's where this project comes in.

Solution:
Provide a simple GUI, allow loading in a template file via the app.
The GUI provides a simple to use API to changes some variables (on css properties for example)

Screenshots will be added soon.
